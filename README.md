# CS4341_Assignment1
Veronica Andrews, Harsh Patel, Carlos Velasquez

Code Execution Instructions:
To execute our code, run the main method in the Game class with the following command line arguments: the name of the file that contains the board you are looking to test (located in our src/boards directory) and the heuristic number (1-6).

Ex. src/boards/board_1.txt 1

Note: All of our analysis was performed on the existing 10 boards in our src/boards directory, but if you would like to test our program with other randomly generated boards you can uncomment the line in the main method that calls our generateBoards(...) method. This method will overwrite the existing boards in the src/boards directory, so we have it commented out as the default.
