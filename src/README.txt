A* Implementation based on Assignment 1 Group of Veronica Andrews, Harsh Patel, and Carlos Velasquez.

To execute our code, run the main method in the Game class with the following command-line
arguments: the name of the file that contains the board you are looking to test (located in our
src/boards directory) and the heuristic number (1-6). This will run 2 hours of simulated boards
and spit out the feature information as a .csv file.
Ex. src/boards/board_1.txt 1

For analysis, run the main method in Analysis, making sure there are 10 boards in the boards folder.
This will create a .csv file that runs Heuristics 5-7 for the 10 boards that contains the number of
nodes expanded and score to goal for each combination of heuristic and board.
